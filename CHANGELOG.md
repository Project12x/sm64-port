# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Default-off `diag-skip-geo` measures a risky duplicate geo-walk upper bound;
  it requires demo/replay and is not a full-game mode or promotion path.
- Declared Saturn-only build support so obsolete PC/N64 guidance cannot imply a
  supported configuration.

### Fixed

- The `diag-skip-geo` host policy gate now executes the real Make validation
  matrix and inspects the actual normal compile-time branch, preventing inert
  comments or the wrong source region from satisfying diagnostic containment.
- `diag-skip-geo` now rejects observable whitespace-padded and malformed flag
  values before any prerequisite, compiler-flag, or output-tag decision, closing
  a spelling that could activate the unsafe diagnostic without demo/replay.
